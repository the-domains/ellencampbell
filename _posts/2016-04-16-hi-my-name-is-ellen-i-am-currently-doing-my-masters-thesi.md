description: "Hi! My Name is Ellen! I am currently doing my Master's thesis at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. Here is a bit about my thesis: My thesis connects my experience as a member of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's Operation Grindstop and Operation Jairo to wider cultural, political, and social understandings of the tactic of direct enforcement. I argue that direct enforcement constitutes an intervention not only into the slaughter of nonhumans but also into political and philosophical discourse that arbitrarily privileges humans over nonhumans. I interrogate the cultural implications of the tactic of direct enforcement by examining the ways their tactics can be seen as literal interventions into the privileging of humans. I also address the axiomatics of imperialism surrounding the global enforcement of international mandates. This critique hopes to determine ways that nonstate organizations can continue to work towards promoting ideological change thorough the tactic of direct enforcement"
